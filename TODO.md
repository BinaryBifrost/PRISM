# What's Next for PRISM

PRISM is an evolving project, and I have several exciting plans to further improve its features and usability. Here are some things I'm working on:

## Auto Reboot Feature

One of the planned features is an automatic reboot function. If a server's uptime exceeds a predetermined threshold, say 45 days, PRISM will automatically initiate a reboot. This feature will help maintain server performance and health.

## Interactive Bot

Currently, PRISM operates as a webhook, but I am planning to develop it into a fully interactive bot. This bot will allow for manual triggers and provide override capabilities, enabling users to enable or disable functions as needed.

## Enhanced Alert Management

To make PRISM even more robust, I'm thinking about implementing an advanced alert management system. This system will intelligently escalate alerts based on severity and repeated occurrence of the same issue. It will also allow for alert acknowledgements to prevent alert fatigue.

## Integration with ITSM Tools

To better fit within existing IT workflows, I'm considering integrating PRISM with popular ITSM tools. This will allow incidents detected by PRISM to be automatically logged as tickets, streamlining the incident response process.
